# PRD: Snap Your Shelf - Digital Blu-ray/DVD Collection Organizer

## 1. Overview

Snap Your Shelf is a digital tool designed to help Blu-ray and DVD collectors organize and keep track of their physical media collections. The application transforms a physical shelf into a digital catalog by allowing users to photograph their collection, tap on detected spines, and quickly build a text-only digital inventory that can be browsed, searched, and shared.

This streamlined MVP focuses on providing a frictionless experience: capture → catalog → organize → share. By eliminating complex features like cover art integration and metadata enrichment, the tool prioritizes speed and simplicity to help collectors efficiently digitize and manage their collections.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Enable Blu-ray/DVD collectors to quickly digitize and organize their physical collections with minimal friction.

**Key Objectives:**
- Provide fast, intuitive collection cataloging through photo-based spine detection
- Create a clean, searchable text-only catalog for easy browsing and organization
- Enable effortless sharing of digital collections via auto-generated catalog images
- Help collectors keep comprehensive track of their Blu-ray/DVD content
- Deliver a solution faster than manual spreadsheet entry

## 3. Non-Goals (MVP Scope)

- Cover art display or integration (manual upload or API-based)
- Real-time AR overlays (static photo-based approach only)
- Deep metadata enrichment (director, year, genre, ratings)
- Advanced collection analytics or recommendations
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Integration with streaming platforms

## 4. Target Users

**Primary Users:** Blu-ray/DVD collectors seeking a fast, no-frills method to digitize and organize their physical collections

- As a collector, I want to tap detected spines and enter titles so I can build my catalog efficiently
- As a collector, I want to browse my movies in a clean, organized text-based interface
- As a collector, I want to search my collection so I can quickly find specific titles
- As a collector, I want to share my digital catalog as an image so others can see what I own
- As a collector, I want to keep track of my Blu-ray content so I avoid duplicate purchases

**Secondary User Stories:**
- As a friend/family member, I want to view shared catalogs so I can see what's available to borrow
- As a collector, I want to sort my collection alphabetically so I can find titles more easily
